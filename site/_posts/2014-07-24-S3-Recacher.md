title: The Amazon S3 Recacher in Golang

*[S3 Recacher](https://github.com/johnvilsack/s3recacher)* is my first publicly distributed application written in [Go](http://www.golang.org). The program will iterate through all objects in an Amazon Web Services S3 bucket and (re)set the Cache-Control http header. 

Several options are available from the command line:

* **age** - Set the cache max-age (in seconds).
* **maxobjs** - How many objects you want to iterate through.
* **startid** - Name of the object to begin your iteration.
* **stopid** - Where you would like the program to stop.
