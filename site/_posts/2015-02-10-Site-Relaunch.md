After another event-filled busy retail season, I am ready to put the final touches on my new site and publish it live.  In addition to the code commit, I'm going to commit myself to posting at least once a month on this blog in an effort to track my interest habits.

My downtime has been spent mostly focused on remodeling my home workshop.  The deeper I dive into [micromanufacturing](http://www.bbc.com/news/business-24203938), the more vast the expanse of knowledge I see in the things I want to learn.
