I planned and developed business analytics software that resulted in recouping over one hundred-thousand dollars in improperly charged shipping expenses by comparing the just-in-time rates with the invoiced rates.

When I presented a demonstration of the tool at a conference as a way to show how custom software could be written to augment the inventory and warehouse management tool Active Sports, Inc. uses, several companies asked for details to purchase the software.  Unfortunately the tool was custom designed for our business, and could not be shared.

A variation of the tool was also used in predictive analysis to determine how distributed warehouses could affect order fulfillment at a cost savings. The tool was also able to generate complete warehouse manifests that ensured that each location carried the most minimal product selection for maximum efficiency.
