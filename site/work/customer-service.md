After recognizing several flaws in the customer service experience, I redesigned our automated e-mail correspondence tools to better engage the customers.

A new API was developed that presented a custom look and feel for each subsidiary of Active Sports, Inc. that could handle over 5,000 messages per day with less than 5 messages per month being flagged for Spam.

Once the Automailer was complete, I extended the system to include a module that automated gift certificate mailing to our customers. This included print-ready graphics for the customer to print at home. Several customers have sent in comment cards and praised the system for saving the day!
