<p>I solve everyday problems through analysis and simplification.. </p>

<p>My specialty is producing ideas and solutions that eliminate the pain points caused by ineffective processes.  My unique blend of business management, technology, programming, and marketing gives me the experience to understand many different parts about how a company works, and to translate the wants and needs between divisions seamlessly.</p>

<p>This allows me to create end-to-end software solutions and accompanying processes that focus on fixing the problems of today; while maintaining the agility to solve the problems of tomorrow.  Nothing pleases me more than solving a challenge that reduces training, increases efficiency, and improves the quality of those using my solutions.</p>

<p>Technology is about making our lives simpler; not complicating them through confusing or obfuscated design. </p>

<p> <strong>I make sure that simple happens.</strong></p>
