<p>I am a Solutions Architect.  I solve every day problems by introducting processes and technological solutions that simplify the lives of those I work with.</p>

<p>My passion is discovering complicated pain points and helping users discover that alternatives can be engineered to not only reduce the pain, but give the user some time back in order to focus on other, more important things.</p>

<p>Technology is about making our lives simpler; not complicating them through confusing interfaces or hoop jumping.  I make sure that doesn't happen.</p>
