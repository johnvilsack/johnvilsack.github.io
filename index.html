I am John Vilsack, the Director of Technology Operations for <a href="http://www.the-house.com" target="_blank">The-House.com</a>, an e-commerce provider of snowboarding and other active sports gear in Saint Paul, Minnesota. I am responsible analyzing business needs and delivering simple, effective solutions.
</p>

<p>
I am conduit between the world of business and the frontier of technology that powers it.  Communicating what can be done by understanding a process and sculpting a project around that is the difference between an end product that helps solve a problem and an end product that impacts the way business works.
</p>

<p>
My work in e-commerce channel development and management has been featured in <a href="http://www.internetretailer.com/2012/03/01/stock-really" target="_blank">Internet Retailer</a> magazine. I currently evangelize the role mobile and wearable devices will play in delivering new opportunities as the virtual world begins to integrate with the psychical world in new and exciting ways.
