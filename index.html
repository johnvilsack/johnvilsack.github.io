<p>John Vilsack is a Solutions Architect who didn't realize that there was even a term for that until he Googled it to write this sentence. 
</p>

<p>
He currently serves as the Director of Technology and Operations for <a href="http://the-house.com">Active Sports, Inc.</a> in St. Paul, Minnesota which has grown from a single Yahoo! store into the largest snowboard e-tailer on the planet.  This role allows him to deliver projects internally that fuse personnel and technology together into simplified solutions that benefit everyone.
</p>

<p>
He is also well-known for poking fun at people who speak in the third person; so he's going to stop.  Right now.

<p>I am an expert in developing solutions through simplification.   

Poor project management, communication, and a lack of empathy for your end user
