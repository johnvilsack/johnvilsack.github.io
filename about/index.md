Pittsburgh, PA ➡ Madison, WI ➡ St. Paul, MN

Here are just a few of the topics that capture my wonder:

### Technology
I love what I do! Most of my free time is spent reading, learning, or playing with the latest in technology.

***

### Programming
I like to create stuff, and programming is my weapon of choice. I started in C, and graduated into Go, Javascript, PHP, and Python depending on need. Lately, I've been learning C# for XR development. 

***

### Gaming
My love of video games got me into technology, and my love for them still burns bright. I love a good game that challenge the ideas of what video game experiences can be.

***

### Snowboarding
I caught the bug working at [The House](http://www.the-house.com) and it's one of the only things that can get me out during cold weather.

***

### Space
My favorite place on Earth is Cape Canaveral, Florida. I am obsessed with all things related to our next frontier.

***

### Photography
I am an avid photographer and love shooting sports and wildlife.

***

### Multimedia
I love TV, books, and movies that ask big questions.

### About This Site
This site was originally designed as a proof-of-concept showcase of what could be done in pure HTML & CSS, without javascript. This makes the site easy to update and fast to load.

I use [Github Pages](https://pages.github.com/) to host the [Liquid Templates](https://shopify.github.io/liquid/) used to build the HTML.
