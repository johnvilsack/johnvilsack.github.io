I was initially hired to handle the technology needs of Active Sports, Inc. as the only person in the company who had a technical background.

Throughout my tenure, I made sure that the company's needs were met for tomorrow as well as today.

In ten years, the company grew from 15 workstations and a few computers in a mail room connected to the Internet through a T1 to over 250 end user devices across five locations and 50 virtual and physical servers in two datacenters linked together securely and speedily across modern bandwidth connections.

This was accomplished not only quickly and efficiently, but at substantial cost savings when compared to other enterprise solutions by engaging unconventional methods.
