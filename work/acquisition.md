2014 saw the acquisition of the bankrupt Altrec.com, a sporting goods e-retailer in Redmond, Oregon that focused more on camping and outdoor gear than our niche did.

The decision to task me with the responsibility of starting a new satellite office and retail showroom that would be staffed by over a dozen retained Altrec employees was made immediately after acquisition.

In just three months, a warehouse and two office spaces filled with newly acquired Active Sports, Inc. assets had been shipped across the country or moved and set up in our new office space in downtown Bend, Oregon. The staff was integrated into the existing company workflows as roles and responsibilities were adjusted to best work with the talents our new teammates across all of our various retail properties.
