I regularly find myself programming custom solutions to solve everyday problems. Many of the reports, dashboards, and applications required to achieve success in many of the other projects listed here were due to tools I developed myself.

I'm an expert in PHP, Javascript, and HTML5 technologies. Recently I've taken to using Go when speed is required and Python when it is not.  I've worked with a variety of frameworks and libraries across all of these different languages, and haven't had a problem coming up to speed on any of them.

The goal of every design is to deliver simplicity to the end user and concise resource usage to the machines serving the data. 

Most projects either use or extend custom REST APIs that were built for speed and re-usability. Responses generally are returned using JSON to allow for simple debugging.
